# Handling Uncommon Resource Access Errors in Java

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error scenario in Java: accessing resources that might be unavailable at runtime. This leads to exceptions like NullPointerException, SecurityException, and others, which require careful handling to avoid application crashes.

The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file showcases this issue where the code tries to access a system property that may not exist.  The solution, found in `UncommonErrorSolution.java`, enhances the code with robust exception handling to gracefully manage the unavailability of the resource.
